dbus-rest

Will be under the eclipse public license, as soon as I get my act together.

Aims to provide simple access to dbus via http and json.  It's not
very RESTful yet ;-)  Created due to my frustrations with the java dbus
library.  Very much a work in progress.

Notes on dbus:
      3 types: get object, publish object, subscribe to notifications
